<h1 id="filepos1042131" class="calibre31"><span class="calibre20">THANKS:</span></h1><div class="calibre32"></div>
<p class="calibre26"><span class="calibre6">My wife Deborah and daughter Claire were on-site first readers and sensitive critics, as ever.</span></p>
<p class="calibre28"><span class="calibre6">Susan Allison, to whom this book is dedicated, and who has been my editor in one sense or another since the start of my career, of course was excellent with this one. </span></p>
<p class="calibre28"><span class="calibre6">As indeed was Martha Millard, my literary agent since I first required one.</span></p>
<p class="calibre28"><span class="calibre6">Jack Womack and Paul McAuley read pages almost daily, with Paul keeping very particular track of London. Louis Lapprend was enlisted as Milgrim arrived in Paris, to similar ends. </span></p>
<p class="calibre28"><span class="calibre6">Cory Doctorow provided Sleight with Milgrim’s problematic Neo.</span></p>
<p class="calibre28"><span class="calibre6">Johan Kugelberg very kindly put me up in the club on which Cabinet is loosely based, and which is very nearly as peculiar.</span></p>
<p class="calibre28"><span class="calibre6">Sean Crawford kept Winnie honest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre28"><span class="calibre6">Larry Lunn gave me the order flow, when asked for a macguffin of ultimate scale. I don’t know anyone else who could have.</span></p>
<p class="calibre28"><span class="calibre6">Clive Wilson very kindly offered boots-on-the-ground Melbourne geography and vegan bacon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre28"><span class="calibre6">Douglas Coupland introduced me to the concept of the Vegas cube by showing me, years ago, the one he’d built to write in.</span></p>
<p class="calibre28"><span class="calibre6">Bruce Sterling, having been emailed exactly the wrong question about CCTV, graciously extruded the concept of the ugly T-shirt in one of his characteristic, demonically focused bursts of seemingly effortless imagination. </span></p>
<p class="calibre28"><span class="calibre6">Michaela Sachenbacher and Errolson Hugh introduced me to the architecture of a “secret” brand, and the passion behind it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre28"><span class="calibre6">Everything I know about being a fashion model in the 21st Century I learned from Jenna Sauers’ wonderful <em class="calibre15">Jezebel</em> memoir, “I Am The Anonymous Model.” Meredith’s modeling career is based on it. Available with a quick Google. </span></p>
<p class="calibre28"><span class="calibre6">Likewise available is Mark Gardiner’s very informative “Artful Dodgers,” from the February 2009 issue of <em class="calibre15">Motorcyclist</em>, where I learned everything I know about London motorcycle couriers. </span></p>
<p class="calibre28"><span class="calibre6">Meredith’s line of shoes was modeled after the brand Callous, launched by Thomas Fenning and Tomoaki Kobayashi in 2003, and which I gather met a somewhat similar fate. </span></p>
<p class="calibre28"><span class="calibre6">Thank you all.</span></p>
