GD module is an interface to the GD library written by Thomas Boutell. 

    gd is a graphics library. It allows your code to quickly draw images 
    complete with lines, arcs, text, multiple colors, cut and paste from 
    other images, and flood fills, and write out the result as a PNG or 
    JPEG file. This is particularly useful in World Wide Web applications,
    where PNG and JPEG are two of the formats accepted for inline images
    by most browsers.

The GD library must be version 2.0.8 or higher (or you must choose version
0.40 or earlier of this module, which supports 1.8.3 or higher).

The official home page of GD is currently:

gdmodule has been extended in some ways from the original GD library.
